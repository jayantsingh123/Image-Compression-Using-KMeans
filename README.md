# Image-Compression-Using-KMeans

In this mini-project, we explore the application of K-means Algorithm to perform Image compression. We have taken few example images, and after some basic pre-processing, decreased the resolution from millions of pixels to handful of pixels without sacrificing too much information regarding the image.
